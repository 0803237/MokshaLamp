# MokshaLamp

I created an web application on lamps and named it Moonlight lamps. In this project I used Models, Views and Controllers. Additionally, I created database
using seedData and for my home page I used https://www.pexels.com/search/lamp/ website for images and https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/navigation/footer/ 
website to create footer.
